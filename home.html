                <p class="about-text">

                    I’m Aamna Junaid, a Communication Design student at ISDI, Atlas SkillTech University, with a deep passion for storytelling through photography and design. Mentored by award-winning landscape and nature photographer Abhijit Bose, I’ve had the privilege of honing my craft under expert guidance, which has shaped my artistic vision and technical skills.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                   I’ve collaborated with a wide range of brands, including Mindgobbling, Vespa, Aprilia, Sister Story Co., Confetti & Cream, Homebred by Gitika, Gourmetly Yours, Satguru Jewellers, Stroom, Chrysellect, Antithesis, Zema Jewellers, Xeha, and Palak Diamonds, among others. These partnerships have allowed me to merge creativity and strategy to deliver impactful visual solutions tailored to each brand's identity.  I am currently in the process of launching my own streetwear brand, Misfit Monkey, which represents individuality and self-expression. This venture allows me to channel my creativity into building a brand that resonates with like-minded individuals who embrace their uniqueness.
